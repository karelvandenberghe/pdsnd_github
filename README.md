### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
